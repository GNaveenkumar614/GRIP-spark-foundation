# EDA -spark-foundation
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis task given by The Sparks Foundation in which we have to work on a Global Terrorism dataset, where we have to find out the hot zone of terrorism and get insights from the dataset through the visualization.we have designed and developed an interactive dashboard to explore Global Terrorism Database ( https://start.umd.edu/gtd/ ), which has information of ~180K terrorist events around the world for the years 1970-2017. This is a video demo of the website.an Exploratory data analysis was done to find hotspots,most used weapons,common targets etc..,
